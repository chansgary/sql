-- Char and varchar
-- data takes different forms

-- Storing texts

-- Char has a fixed length, while the length of varchar can be changed!!!
-- Char(3) -- only three characters are allowed, fixed size, longest one is 255

-- char is faster for fixed length text!!!
-- states abbreviations: CA,NY
-- yes/no flags: Y/N
-- Sex: M/F

-- Otherwise use varchar

CODE: Data Types Exercises Solution
What's a good use case for CHAR?
------
Used for text that we know has a fixed length, e.g., State abbreviations,
abbreviated company names, sex M/F, etc.

CREATE TABLE inventory (
    item_name VARCHAR(100),
    price DECIMAL(8,2),
    quantity INT
);

What's the difference between DATETIME and TIMESTAMP?
------
They both store datetime information, but there's a difference in the range,
TIMESTAMP has a smaller range. TIMESTAMP also takes up less space.
TIMESTAMP is used for things like meta-data about when something is created
or updated.
